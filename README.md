## Abstract
We present a general analysis for finding and characterizing nonlinear exceptional point (EP) lasers above
threshold using steady-state ab initio Maxwellâ€“Bloch equations. For a system of coupled slabs, we show that a
nonlinear EP is obtained for a given ratio between the external pumps in each resonator and that it is associated
with a kink in the output power and lasing frequency, confirming coupled-mode theory predictions. Through
numerical linear stability analysis, we confirm that the EP laser can be stable for a large enough inversion relaxation
rate. We further show that the EP laser can be characterized by scattering a weak signal off the lasing cavity so
that the scattering frequency spectrum exhibits a quartic divergence. Our approach can be applied to arbitrary
scatterers with multi-level gain media. Our reproduced results are inspired by the work of Mohammed Benzaouia,
A. D. Stone, and Steven G. Johnson in their paper on this subject.
